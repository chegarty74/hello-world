-I set up a local server on my Mac with XAMPP.

-I added a form to a Bootstrap page I'd already built to get familiar with Bootstrap

-I converted the index page to PHP and put it the file on the server

-I created the .txt file to write the info to.

-I googled the code, found examples and parsed them.

-The form-submission.php created the variables using $_POST.

-It then opens the text file, and sets permission to read, write and append to the last line.

-It creates a variable containing the string with the form entries.

-The fwrite() function opens the text file and writes the string.

-The fclose() function closes the text files.

-The last line echos a success message.
